# Overview 
Movement provides an overall view of the thousands of data elements found in NIEM that are used throughout the government and beyond for some [pretty amazing things](https://www.niem.gov/about-niem/success-stories). It’s a user-friendly interface that delivers smarter search results and a streamlined way to build lightweight JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Schema. 

Driven by and for users, this tool enables anyone to explore what NIEM has to offer, regardless of model expertise or technical understanding. It’s the first step to enable greater flexibility and simplicity when interacting and leveraging NIEM.

[Learn more about Movement](http://niem.github.io/movement/)—what you are searching, sample of the JSON Schema output, and more.

To learn more about what NIEM is doing with JSON overall, our [JSON overview page](https://www.niem.gov/techhub/json) is a great place to start. 

The Movement tool is an exciting glimpse into the future of NIEM, and we can’t wait to see what the community accomplishes by using it. Visit [beta.movement.niem.gov](https://beta.movement.niem.gov) to access the tool. 

## Got feedback? 
We want to hear from you! You can provide your feedback directly on GitHub by [opening an issue](https://github.com/NIEM/Movement/issues) or though [contacting us](https://niem.gov/contact-us) on NIEM.gov. 

# Getting Started
The code behind Movement is open source and available on GitHub. To help make the Movement tool more modular, we've broken the tool into three distinct repositories:
* [Front-end](https://github.com/NIEM/movement-frontend) for the web app and UI
* [Back-end](https://github.com/NIEM/movement-backend) for any API requests, specifically the JSON Schema transformation
* [Solr](https://github.com/NIEM/movement-solr) for storage and querying of NIEM data elements

To make a contribution to one of these repositories, visit the links above where you will find more detailed "Getting Started" and technical information specific to each repository.

## How to contribute
Since this tool was born out of collaboration with users, it’s open source—so that the community that inspired Movement can continue to contribute to its evolution. 

### Tool Developers:
We have ideas for additional functionality we’d love to see get implemented in the tool. If you want to join the Movement, here are a few suggestions for contributions:
*	Extension schema functionality for properties that are not in NIEM
*	Have the User Interface display the Codelist options 
*	Export formats other than JSON Schema (XSD, Java Library, .NET Library, NIEM UML, etc.)
*	Implement profiles and dashboards to build you exchanges with a group
*	Organizational data dictionary import
*	Import of existing NIEM exchanges

NIEM has created an automated build pipeline to allow developers an easy way to modify and improve the tool—facilitating developers to build off the source code and submit their pull requests.

### Tool Users:
We are very interested in hearing your vision for future evolution of the tool as well as your general feedback on the capabilities. You can provide your feedback directly on GitHub by [opening an issue](https://github.com/NIEM/Movement/issues) or though [contacting us](https://niem.gov/contact-us) on NIEM.gov.
