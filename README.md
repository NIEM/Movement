# Overview 
Movement provides an overall view of the thousands of data elements found in NIEM that are used throughout the government and beyond for some [pretty amazing things](https://www.niem.gov/about-niem/success-stories). It’s a user-friendly interface that delivers smarter search results and a streamlined way to build lightweight JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Schema. 

Driven by and for users, this tool enables anyone to explore what NIEM has to offer, regardless of model expertise or technical understanding. It’s the first step to enable greater flexibility and simplicity when interacting and leveraging NIEM.

# Getting Started
The code behind Movement is open source and available on GitHub. To help make the Movement tool more modular, we've broken the tool into three distinct repositories:
* [Front-end](https://github.com/NIEM/movement-frontend) for the web app and UI
* [Back-end](https://github.com/NIEM/movement-backend) for any API requests, specifically the JSON Schema transformation
* [Solr](https://github.com/NIEM/movement-solr) for storage and querying of NIEM data elements

To make a contribution to one of these repositories, visit the links above where you will find more detailed "Getting Started" and technical information specific to each repository.
